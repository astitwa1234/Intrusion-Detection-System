# Intrusion-Detection-System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security technology designed to detect and alert on potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on a network or computer system
Types of IDS:
Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):

Deployment: Placed at strategic points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network.
Function: Analyzes incoming and outgoing traffic to detect suspicious activities and potential threats.
Example: Snort, Suricata.
Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):

Deployment: Installed on individual hosts or devices within the network.
Function: Monitors and analyzes the internals of a computing system, such as operating system activities, file integrity, and system logs.
Example: OSSEC, Tripwire.
Detection Methods:
Signature-based Detection:

Mechanism: Relies on predefined patterns or signatures of known threats. It compares incoming data against a database of known attack signatures.
Pros: Effective against known threats.
Cons: Ineffective against new or unknown threats (zero-day attacks).
Anomaly-based Detection:

Mechanism: Establishes a baseline of normal behavior and detects deviations from this baseline as potential threats.
Pros: Can detect new and unknown threats.
Cons: May produce more false positives as legitimate activity may deviate from the baseline.
Hybrid Detection:

Mechanism: Combines both signature-based and anomaly-based methods to improve detection accuracy.
Pros: Balances the strengths of both methods.
Cons: Can be more complex to implement and manage.
Key Functions:
Monitoring and Analysis: Continuously monitors network traffic or system activity to identify suspicious patterns.
Alerting: Sends alerts to administrators or security personnel when potential threats are detected.
Logging: Records detailed logs of detected activities for further analysis and investigation.
Response: Some advanced IDS can take predefined actions in response to detected threats, such as blocking traffic or isolating affected systems.
Importance of IDS:
Early Detection: Identifies potential security breaches before they can cause significant damage.
Compliance: Helps organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements for security monitoring.
Incident Response: Provides critical information for investigating and responding to security incidents.
Continuous Improvement: Helps in understanding attack patterns and improving overall security posture.
In summary, an IDS is an essential component of a comprehensive security strategy, providing crucial visibility into potential threats and helping to safeguard network and system integrity.
